- system is higher throughput, 1000s of images
- system allows for consistent strip placement in images
- system allows for consistent timing of photography between strips
- system allows for deliberate variation of lighting and chemistry parameters

10-18-20
- exact time when each strip is initiated and button press confirms placement should be noted in array
    - this could allow for higher accuracy when timing subsequent images of same strip
    - does not need to be complex, program could just wait for "x" seconds if strip was delayed, etc.
